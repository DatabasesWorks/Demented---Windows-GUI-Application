# Demented---Windows-GUI-Application
Graphical user interface on Windows for managing Inventory inside public clothing store using QT, SQL, and C++.

Demented is a local clothing store located in Pomona, CA.
I was a frequent visitor to the shop and I noticed at purchases, they were using 
calculators and notebooks. At the time I was learning how to program GUI applications
on my own so I thought, why not give myself a goal and make a program that this business
can use so that we both benefit from it? I started by making a demo that took me two weeks of learning ad programming
that showed what the basic functionality would be and asked if this would be something they'd be interested in.
They said, "Of course we'd be interested! Butwhat's the cost?" I told them, as long as they stay dedicated to 
the program and give me feedback, It's free.

Objective:
The objective of this program is to minimize the labor work of paper and pencil to zero. Also, to sort
the products in the store so that every item can be found and so that they know whats the quantity of
each product all on one screen.
